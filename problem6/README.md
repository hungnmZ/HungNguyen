## Overview

This module provides the backend functionality for a real-time gaming scoreboard. It includes endpoints to update user scores, fetch the top 10 users, and retrieve an individual user's rank. The module ensures real-time updates and security against unauthorized score modifications.

## Endpoints

### POST /v1/scores

#### Description: Updates a user's score on the scoreboard.

- Request Parameters:
  - user_id (string): The ID of the user who completed an action.
  - points (integer): The number of points to add to the user's score.
- Response:
  - 200 OK: Successfully updated the user's score.
  - 400 Bad Request: Failed to update the user's score.

#### Example Request:

    {
      "user_id": "user123",
      "points": 10
    }

#### Example Response:

    {
      "status": "success"
    }

### GET /v1/scores

#### Description: Fetches the top 10 players from the scoreboard.

- Response:
  - 200 OK: Successfully retrieved the top 10 players.

#### Example Response:

    {
      "data": [
        {
          "user_id": "user1",
          "user_name": "alice",
          "rank": 1,
          "score": 12543
        },
        {
          "user_id": "user2",
          "user_name": "bob",
          "rank": 2,
          "score": 11500
        }
      ],
      "total": 10
    }

### GET /v1/scores/{user_id}

#### Description: Fetches the rank of a specific user.

- Request Parameters:
  - user_id (string): The ID of the user whose rank we would like to fetch.
- Response:
  - 200 OK: Successfully retrieved the user's rank.

#### Example Request:

    {
    "user_id": "user123"
    }

#### Example Response:

    {
      "user_info": {
        "user_id": "user123",
        "score": 1000,
        "rank": 6
      }
    }

## High-Level Architecture

The system consists of two main services: the Game Service and the Scoreboard Service.

1. Game Service: Handles game logic and validates user actions.
2. Scoreboard Service: Manages the scoreboard, updates scores, and retrieves scoreboard data.

#### Workflow

1. User Action: A user completes an action in the game.
2. Score Update: The Game Service validates the action and sends a request to the Scoreboard Service to update the score.
3. Scoreboard Update: The Scoreboard Service updates the user's score in the scoreboard store.
4. Data Retrieval: Users can request the top 10 scoreboard or their specific rank directly from the Scoreboard Service.

## Relational Database Solution

- Scoreboard Table:
  - user_id (string): User's ID.
  - score (integer): User's score.

#### Example SQL Queries:

- Insert or update user score:

      INSERT INTO scoreboard (user_id, score) VALUES ('user123', 1)
      ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE score = score + 1;

- Fetch top 10 users:

      SELECT user_id, score FROM scoreboard ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 10;

- Fetch user rank:

      SELECT user_id, score, FIND_IN_SET( score, (
      SELECT GROUP_CONCAT( score ORDER BY score DESC )
      FROM scoreboard )
      ) AS rank
      FROM scoreboard
      WHERE user_id = 'user123';

## Redis Solution

- If we only use SQL, it can cause performance problems. Use Redis to ensure real-time scoreboard updates.
- Use Redis sorted sets for efficient scoreboard operations.
- We store user_id and score in Redis. When we have the user_id, we can get user details or cache them in Redis too.

### Redis Commands:

- Increment user score:

  ZINCRBY scoreboard 1 user123

- Fetch top 10 users:

  ZREVRANGE scoreboard 0 9 WITHSCORES

- Fetch user rank:

  ZREVRANK scoreboard user123

## Security

To prevent unauthorized score modifications:

- Only allow internal API calls from the Game Service to update scores.
- Use authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure API endpoints.
- Validate all incoming requests to ensure they are from trusted sources.

## Scalability

- Sharding: Implement sharding strategies for Redis to handle large-scale data.
- Benchmarking: Continuously benchmark and optimize the system to handle peak loads.

## Additional Comments

1. Caching: Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce load on the database.
2. Monitoring: Set up monitoring and alerting for the scoreboard service to detect and resolve issues promptly.
